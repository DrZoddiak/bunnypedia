It is important to place the two (or more) Barrier cards side by side between the players especially if one of the Barriers is a Neutronium Barrier. This becomes important when a Roaming Red Run card encounters the Barriers. By placing the cards side by side, players will be able to determine if a Roaming Red Run will encounter a regular Barrier and change direction, or a Neutronium Barrier and be eliminated."}
